# 🧮 Visual Sorting Algorithms
[![GitHub Pages](https://img.shields.io/badge/Live-Demo-green?style=flat&logo=github)](https://JakkaSanthosh.github.io/visual-sorting-algorithms)

A visually engaging web-based tool that demonstrates how popular sorting algorithms work step-by-step using animations.

## 🚀 Features

- **Five Sorting Algorithms**:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
- Intuitive UI with animated bars for step-by-step visualization.
- Adjustable array size and sorting speed (Coming soon!).

## 🛠️ Built With

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (ES6)

## 📸 Demo

## 📁 Project Structure


## 🧠 How It Works

Each algorithm manipulates a visual array of bars using color changes to show:
- Comparisons
- Swaps
- Final sorted order

Animations are timed using `setTimeout()` to clearly display each operation.

## 💡 Learning Outcome

- Deep understanding of sorting algorithms
- Improved problem-solving and debugging skills
- Hands-on practice with DOM manipulation and animations

## 📌 Future Enhancements

- Speed control slider
- Theme switch (dark/light)
- Add more algorithms (Heap Sort, Radix Sort, etc.)
